This project is a Banking Management System developed using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes and objects. It integrates with a MySQL database to perform secure and efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The system enables users to register and log in securely, create and manage bank accounts, and perform various account-related operations. Additionally, it supports fund transfers between accounts using unique account numbers, ensuring accurate and reliable transaction processing.

The application demonstrates strong backend development practices, database integration, and implementation of real-world banking functionalities.
